# Signalling, reciprocity, and the evolution of cooperation

Code used to implement the model, analyse the results and create the plots included in the article "Signalling boosts the evolution of cooperation in repeated group
interactions".

"functions.py" includes common functions used by the different scripts. "scripts_main.py" includes some of the scripts (it is neccesary to change parameters and run different parts depending on the analyses to be performed).
Subdirectories contains variations of the previous files and generate other different analyses.
